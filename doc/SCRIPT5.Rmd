# Summary

This project builds a classification model using logistic regression to analyze various diabetic patient features to predict whether or not the patient will be readmitted to the hospital again or not. 

# Introduction

For this project, we are trying to answer the predictive question: Given a diabetic patient’s demographic, medication history and management of diabetes during hospital stay, can we predict if they will be readmitted to the hospital or not? 

Analysis with machine learning models will identify features more likely to predict patient readmission. This will be important for management of hospital care for diabetic patients, because it will identify areas where changes can be made to decrease patient readmission and reduce burden on the healthcare system.

# Methods

The R programming language [@R] and Python programming language [@Python] were used to perform the analysis. The following R and Python packages were also used to perform the analysis:

* Knitr [@knitr]
* Numpy [@Numpy]
* Pandas [@Pandas]
* Altair [@Altair]
* Hashlib [@Hashlib]
* Matplotlib [@Matplotlib]
* iPython [@iPython]
* Scikit [@Scikit]
* Requests [@Requests]
* Zipfile [@Zipfile]
* Urllib [@Urllib]
* io [@io]
* Warnings [@Warnings]

For statistical analysis (SCRIPT4) specifically:

* StackOverflow [@DSCI571Stack]
* store_vals_function [@DSCI571Var]

## Data

Due to Covid-19, it is critical to reduce the burden on the healthcare system and prevent readmission rates from increasing to make space for Covid cases. Our predictor aims to look at the diabetes management and diagnosis during a patient’s hospital stay to understand how much this affects their readmission. This will allow us to create and improve patient safety protocols to better manage diabetic patients during their hospital stay to provide effective care and prevent readmission during this critical time.  
The data are submitted on behalf of the Center for Clinical and Translational Research, Virginia Commonwealth University, a recipient of NIH CTSA grant UL1 TR00058, and a recipient of the CERNER data. This dataset was collected from 1998-2008 among 130 hospitals and integrated delivery networks throughout the United States of America. 

This data set was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [@UCI] and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008#). Research from this collected data was used to assess diabetic care during hospitalization and determine if patients were likely to be readmitted or not. The paper by [@paper] can be found [here](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/). Each row corresponds a unique encounter with a diabetic patient, totaling 74,036,643 unique encounters. Details about each column feature of information collected during these unique encounters can be found [here](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/tab1/). 

## Analysis

After data cleaning, machine learning model logistic regression (LR) was tested against RBF SVM and a baseline dummy classifier method. LR was determined as the best model in terms of fit and score time, accuracy, and f1 score. Continuing with LR, hyperparameters were optimized and our model was then used to predict diabetic patient readmission (found in the readmitted target column of the data set).

To improve our model in the future to further analyze patient readmission, we can recommend three main suggestions. First, rather than subsetting our data to take a representative and random sample of 1000, we can take a larger subset or even use our entire data set of roughly 70,000 observations. Our reasoning for sub setting the data was to reduce fit and score time of our models. In future models, the use of a larger data set will provide more accurate predictions, reduce bias, and identify outliers that may skew our results. Second, other classifier models such as random forest could be used to test against our logistic regression model to improve predictions. The use of logistic regression assumes there is a linear relationship the independent and dependent variables, which may not be the case in our project. Random forest are non-parametric and will bypass this linearity assumption associated with logistic regression. Third, our model analyzes a binary classification of readmission although the original data set was a multi-classification of readmission (not readmitted, readmitted for less than 30 days, readmitted for more than 30 days). By using a multi-classification model instead, we can generate a more specific prediction and analyze the severity of features related to readmission time, making our conclusions more informative to improving the healthcare system.
