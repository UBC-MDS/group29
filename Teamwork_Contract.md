### Communication
* Main communication will be done via GitHub issues and Slack channel.

The Slack channel will be mainly used for all other project tasks and deadlines communication, including small suggestions and tips or links to help with certain tasks.
* Emergency and last minute details communication will be done viz Whatsapp. This includes any emergent information regarding changing code or documentation, as well as emergent information about sudden schedule changes.
* Agenda (member tasks and milestone checklist) and meeting minutes will be posted on Google Docs.
* Everyone will meet during the Wednesday DSCI 522 lab session, and will coordinate to meet again at least once before the submission deadline. During this final meeting, all members must "okay" the project before subnmission. Meetings will begin with a runthrough of the Google Docs agenda to understand what has been done and what needs to be discussed and worked on.

### Expectations
* Everyone is expected to complete and be responsible for their specific task, as outlined during the group meeting.
* Everyone is expected to attend the specified meetings unless communicated with the group beforehand.
* Everyone is expected to communicate effectively and efficiently with the whole of the group, as outlined in the communication guidelines.
* Everyone is expected to pull from the main repository to their branch before beginning to change any work on their branch, to ensure no consequential merge conflicts.

### Dealing With Conflicts
* A democracy style conflict management approach will be used during this project, where the majority vote will be chosen. This will ensure that each member has a vote before any major decisions are made. Voting may be done anonymously as well, to eliminate any possible bias.
* Any conflict between group members will first be dealt with among the entire group. If unresolved, the course instructor or teaching assistants will be called upon as mediators to resolve the conflict.

### Specific Responsibilities
* Project tasks will be divided up equally among group members.
* Everyone will help manage and complete all project tasks, however, there will be one member responsible for managing each task. 
* Each member will be outlined specific responsibilities in which they are in charge of ensuring are completed and of high quality.
* Everyone will help manage and review each milestone, however, each milestone submission will be specifically responsible by one member to triple-check and also submit onto GitHub and Canvas.
